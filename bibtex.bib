	abstract = {Abstract We introduce Spatial Tuples, an extension of the basic tuple-based model for distributed multi-agent system coordination where (a) tuples are conceptually placed in regions of the physical world and possibly move anchored to a mobile computational device, (b) the behaviour of standard Linda coordination primitives is extended so as to depend on the spatial properties of the coordinating agents, tuples, and the topology of space, and (c) the tuple space can be conceived as a virtual layer augmenting physical reality. Motivated by the needs of mobile augmented-reality applications, Spatial Tuples explicitly aims at supporting space-aware and space-based coordination in agent-based pervasive computing scenarios. This paper presents the coordination model, its formalization as a process algebra, a library of patterns of coordination it enables, and a discussion of application scenarios, challenges, and open issues for future works.},

abstract="Intelligence and interaction are two key -issues in the engineering of todaycomp lex systems, like Internet-based ones. To make logic languages accomplish their vocation of sound enabling technologies for intelligent components, we first need their implementations to strictly meet some engineering properties such as deployability, configurability, and scalability. Then, we should provide them with a wide range of interaction capabilities, according to standards and common practices. This would make logic-based systems also viable tools to build deployable, configurable, dynamic, and possibly intelligent infrastructures.",
